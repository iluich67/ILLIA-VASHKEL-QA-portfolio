Applying for a position of a Junior QA Engineer/ QA Trainee.  
I am focused on extending my functional testing skills with no relevant commercial experience but having a strong desire for development in software testing.

I am a purposeful and highly motivated person who can adjust quickly to new surroundings.
My qualities such as sociability, flexibility and dependability make me good at teamwork. 
I am well organized and detail oriented which I believe is a key to successfully managing responsibilities. 
Currently Iâ€™m looking for a challenging environment where I can improve both hard and soft skills on a day-to-day basis by improving a software quality.
My priority goal is to obtain a position in a company that offers a variety of projects with growth potential in terms of individual and professional development.
